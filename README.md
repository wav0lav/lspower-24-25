# FOR DATA FILTRATION: 

Use this code to start out: 

It calles the dataFiltrationMain function, which is just a bunch of work to 
filter/format the data beforehand that is all used by various people later on 
from dataFIltrationMain import dataFiltrationMain

daily_averages_df, individual_data_df, merged_df, yellow_df, green_df, filtered_df = dataFiltrationMain()

add any extra functions to output what you need
